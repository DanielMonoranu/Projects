#PROJECTS:

I made my first Arduino beginner project in my second year at UPT. 
I used everything I learned in my course about microcontrollers and made a program that uses interrupt routines programmed internally with registers: a led that flashes once a second, another led with a dimming effect obtained with PWM signal and an additional Led that is on only at a specific temperature. The isolated functionalities were simple enough to make, but the integration of every module proved to be quite difficult to implement.

The second project was made in my third year at university. This one is a PID controller that regulates the temperature using a light bulb and an LM35 sensor. I implemented a state machine pattern that has a state for every variable to be set: the timing for the 3 distinct processes: heating, the maintaining of temperature, and cooling.
